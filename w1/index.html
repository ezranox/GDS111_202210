I wasn't happy at all..In what was suppoussed to be my junior year I met this girl just as COVID-19 was starting.. She told me that her mother was abusive and that she needed help. My family moved her into my home. We then got into a relationship where behind closed doors was nothing but traumatizing.. She became mentally, verbally, physically absuive..Amongst other things..
