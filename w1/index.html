 <hr>

<p>I am not going to lie; writing a two paragraph bio about myself is <b>hard</b>, especially when I am trying to escape everything to do with me. I grew up in NYC, Queens; for 22 years of my life. I was always someone who stuck to themselves and it was hard for me to make friends up until Highschool. In highschool I became well known because of the group I hung out with, but they weren't the best people to have surrounded myself with. After fracturing my knee, I completely gave up on succeding in highschool. My dream of becoming a sports player or a Marine like my father was completely thrown off. For me, life grew worse and worse after that.. I lost track of everything that was important. My grades started depleting and I started to become someone that nobody knew. It was a suprise to me that I managed to graduate on time with the corect class. I proceeded to go straight to college in NYC. I thought that Law would be my best option, seeing that my mother was so excited for me to become a lawyer. With all of the pressure of being the first in my family to graduate I did my best to not fail my family. I wasn't happy at all..In what was suppoussed to be my junior year I met this girl just as COVID-19 was starting.. She told me that her mother was abusive and that she needed help. My family moved her into my home. We then got into a relationship where behind closed doors was nothing but traumatizing.. She became mentally, verbally, physically absuive..Amongst other things.. I lost hope once again within myself. I was trapped. </p>

<p>My mother and I haven't always had the best relationship. She struggles with un-diagnosed BPD and so I knew that I always had to walk on eggshells. When I moved out with my companion <i>Emily</i>, everything got so much worse but also so much better. My mom completely dis-owned me. We haven't spoke in what will be 4 months October 15th,2021.. But I am alive because of Emily. She shows me that life is worth living.. And so I moved into my own apartment; re-applied for college here at NEIT and will <strong>make a year</strong> with my companion on <em>Halloween!</em> I have a lot to work on, but I am confident after getting this far that there is so much more opportunity for me. I have faith that my college career will benefit my stream career and eventhough losing my family was hard; I am creating a new one through my girlfriend and through my stream life.
